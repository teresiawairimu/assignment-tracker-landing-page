    <h2>Progress tracking</h2>
    <p>
      The progress tracking feature allows users to monitor the status of their assignments and tasks. 
      It provides a visual indicator (e.g., completed list) showing how much work is done. 
      Users can update list as they progress, helping them stay organized and on top of their workload.

    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      I fell ill while in graduate school and was hospitalized for a few days. 
      The recovery took a few more days, so I was unable to attend classes or submit assignments. 
      I was advised to use task management to organize my assignments and prioritize them based on deadlines. 
      This project was developed as a way to make prioritizing assignments easier. I also wanted to learn about the technologies involved, 
      and this project is being submitted as part of the ALX Software Engineering Program's Portfolio Project.
